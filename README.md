# PhatigueD? Application to aid the mental health of PhD students

This prototype was created during the Junction2022 hackathon by Humera Banoo, Garipally Jhansi, Fengyu Li, Alaa Eddine Somate and Anja Hartewig. 

## Background
PhD students have a six times higher risk of developing mental health problems compared to the general population (Hefner and Eisenberg, 2009). More than 40% show signs of depression or anxiety. Many do not seek help since mental disorders are almost advertised as a badge of honor.
Our application seeks to create a safe space for the students to discuss with peers or persons with a completed PhD in a completely anonymous way, ensuring that even difficult topics such as supervision can be brought up without fear of consequences. This is achieved by only gathering absolutely necessary information. To ensure that a suitable conversation partner can be found, the user can specify the broad topic he or she wants to talk about or select their field of study to discuss field-specific issues. The mental health of the user will be assessed using a sandbox building game that can be retaken to track progress. The conversation among the users can take place in a voice or text-based format. After the conversation the user will be asked to provide feedback on the helpfulness.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
